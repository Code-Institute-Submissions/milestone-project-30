### Project Brief

In this project, you'll build an interactive front-end site.

The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

- Create a site that calls on the Google Maps API to allow users to search for their next running event.

THe site will help users:

- Naviagte through each event on the map
- Find running events
- Provide event locations in a manner that is visually appealing for your user (by drawing on the skills you have learned in User-Centric Frontend Development)
